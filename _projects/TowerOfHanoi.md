The Tower of Hanoi Simulation project is an interactive and graphical representation of the classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle implemented using the MonoGame framework. It provides users with a visual demonstration of the puzzle's rules and movements, allowing them to interact with the simulation.

## Introduction

The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle that involves three pegs and a set of disks of different sizes. The objective is to move the entire stack of disks from one peg to another, following specific rules:

  1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
  2. A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.
  3. The goal is to move all the disks from the starting peg to the destination peg.

## Features

The Tower of Hanoi Simulation project includes the following features:

  - **Graphical Representation:** Visual representation of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle using MonoGame.
  - **Customizable Disks:** Adjustable number of disks to simulate different puzzle sizes.
  - **Pause and Resume:** Ability to pause and resume the simulation for better observation.
  - **Move Counter:** Displays the number of moves made during the simulation.
  - **Interactive Controls:** Simple controls to interact with the simulation (e.g., pause/resume with left-click, exit with 'Esc').

## Usage

To use the Tower of Hanoi Simulation:

  1. Launch the application.
  2. Enter the number of disks to start the simulation.
  3. Left-click on the simulation window to pause or resume the simulation.
  4. Press the 'Esc' key to exit the application.
