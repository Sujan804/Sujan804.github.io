Hello, I’m Md. Sujan Miah, A passionate and driven software engineer specializing in GIS and geospatial technologies. Born and raised in Rowmari, Kurigram, I have always prioritized education and personal growth. I completed my primary education at Boalmari Govt. Primary School and went on to excel in high school at Shoulmari MR High School and Sadek Hossain Memorial School, earning the prestigious **“অদম্য মেধাবী (Indomitable Talent)”** award from the District Commissioner in 2016 for my academic achievements.

In 2018, I graduated from Kurigram Government College and completed my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Mymensingh Engineering College, affiliated with the [University of Dhaka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Dhaka), in early 2024. My academic journey has been marked by a deep interest in technology and innovation, particularly in the field of programming.

Since July 2023, I have been working with [Neo Adaptive Functioning Intelligence](https://nafi-usa.com/), contributing to projects such as EUNWAN – Green AI Simulation and NUSHUR – Disaster Training Simulation, where I apply my computer science and GIS skills to solve real-world challenges. Additionally, I joined the  [Army War Game Centre, Bangladesh Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARTDOC#:~:text=Army%20War%20Game%20Centre) in February 2024, where I work as a Software Engineer, focusing on developing constructive simulations and utilizing GIS for real-world mapping applications.

I am highly interested in urban planning, remote sensing, and the potential of machine learning in GIS. I actively working with open-source GIS libraries and research projects, exploring innovative ways to use geospatial data to enhance urban planning and environmental sustainability.

My goal is to continue expanding my expertise in GIS technology, contribute to the geospatial community, and apply these skills to projects that make a tangible difference, both in Bangladesh and globally.
