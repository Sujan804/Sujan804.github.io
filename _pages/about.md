My name is Md. Sujan Miah and I was born into a middle-class family in Rowmari, Kurigram. Education was always a priority in my family, and I was fortunate enough to attend Boalmari Govt. Primary School where I completed my primary education in 2010. I then went on to study at Shoulmari MR High School and Sadek Hossain Memorial School where I completed my high school education in 2016 with remarkable results. My hard work and dedication paid off when I was awarded the "অদম্য মেধাবী **(INDOMITABLE TALENT)**" award by the District Commissioner (DC) for my academic achievements in 2016.

In 2018, I completed my Higher Secondary education at Kurigram Government College, where I continued to excel in my studies. Currently, I'm pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Mymensingh Engineering College. With a growth mindset and a passion for learning, I'm always striving to better myself and expand my knowledge.

Programming has always been a keen interest of mine, and I've solved over 1000+ problems on various online judges. This allowed me to become an ICPC regionalist in 2023, which is a testament to my dedication and hard work. I'm currently working on various projects, including a Library Management website. This project has given me the opportunity to apply my skills and knowledge while making a positive contribution to society.

I have a particular interest in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, and I'm constantly researching and learning more about these fields. I believe that these technologies have the potential to revolutionize the way we live and work, and I'm eager to contribute to their development.

In my free time, I enjoy traveling and cycling. Traveling allows me to explore new places and learn about different cultures, while cycling keeps me active and helps me unwind. I believe that it's important to find a balance between work and leisure, and these hobbies allow me to do just that.

In summary, I'm a dedicated and hardworking individual with a passion for learning and technology. I've worked hard to achieve my academic goals, and I'm committed to making a positive impact on the world. With my strong work ethic and interest in technology, I'm confident that I'll make a significant contribution to the field in the years to come.
